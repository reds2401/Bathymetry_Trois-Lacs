# Bathymetry_Trois-Lacs
Bathymetries for the Trois-Lacs area
Bathymetries are calculated for water depths using an **Ordinary Kriging** interpolation. Input data comes in the form of text files containing X Y coordinates and water depths, and can come from ADCP measurements or previous bathymetry maps.
